///
/// To use your AIR with the STARK prover/verifier, you'll need to also implement
/// the p3-air traits using the `impl_p3_air_traits!` macro.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `F`: The base field type
/// - `EF`: The extension field type (used for auxiliary traces like LogUp)
///
/// # Required Methods
///
/// - [`width`](MidenAir::width) - Number of columns in the main trace
/// - [`eval`](MidenAir::eval) - Constraint evaluation logic
///
/// # Optional Methods (with default implementations)
///
/// All other methods have default implementations that can be overridden as needed.
